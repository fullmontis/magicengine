* TODO: 
 - move states to own file and object to allow reusability
 - eliminate _this variable because it makes reading the source much
  more difficult
 - Sprite rotation
 - Tiled map display and management
 - Sound extension
 - State Manager
 - remove bindings to states somehow since they are ugly as hell and 
   make the source unreadable (encapsulate state data?)
 - move resource loading to own file
 - add boundaries collision
 - improve framerate (there are some dropped frames)
 - add fps counter
